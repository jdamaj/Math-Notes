Can consider more complex shapes: (Insert Figure) \\

\noindent
Given subspaces $X_1, \ldots X_n$ of $X= \bigcup_{i=1}^n X_j$, if there is a point $p$ in $X$ such that $X_j \cap X_k = \{p\}$ for all $j,k$ we say that $X$ is the wedge of $X_1, \ldots, X_n$. \\ 
If $X$ is the wedge of $n$ circles, then $\pi_1(X) = F_n$ \\

(Insert Figure - infinite earing)

\noindent
If $X^{\cT} = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} X_n^{\cT_n}$, $\cT$ and $\cT_n$ are coherent if each subset $A \subseteq X$ is closed iff $A \cap X_n$ is closed for each $n$ 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\infty$ earing is not coherent, consdier $A = (0, \infty) \times \{0\}$ 
\end{itemize}
For each $n$, let $X_n = S^1$ with $*_n$ base point. Then form $S^1 \times \bN$, define an equivalence relation by $(*_m, m) \sim (*_n, n)$ for all $n,m$. $(S^1 \times \bN)$, form quotient topology, then $\pi_1$ is $F_{\infty}$\\

\noindent
Recall $T = S^1 \times S^1$, $\pi_1(T) = \bZ \times \bZ = \bZ^2$. Can also do this with covering spaces since $T = \bR^2/\bZ^2$. For thea action of $\bZ^2$ on $\bR^2$, consider a fundamental domain $[0,1) \times [0,1)$, its closure is $[0,1] \times [0,1]$, and we can identify opposite edges, get a map $\bR^2 \to T$. \\

Also get map $D \to T$, image of the boundary of $D$ like loop $f*g*f^{-1}*g^{-1}$
