\subsection{Closed Surfaces}

(Insert Figure)

Every closed surface that is made of a connected sum of tori is homeomorphic to $S^2$ with the corresponding number of handles attached. \\
$P^2$ with a disk removed is is a Mobius Strip (boundary is a circle). $P^2 \# P^2 \cong$ $S^2$ with a Mobious strip attached. A surface made from connected sums of $P^2$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$ with the corresponding number of Mobius strips attached. \\
Any connected surface of connected sums of $T$'s and $P^2$'s with at least one $P^2$ is $\cong$ to a sum with only $P^2$'s. (Note: sums that contain $P^2$ are non orientable) \\ 

\noindent
Closed surfaces come from schemes where each letter aooears exactly twice - ``proper schemes''. We say that at scheme is of torus type if whenever a letter is in the scheme its inverse is on the scheme. Otherwise we say the scheme is of projective type.
