\subsection{Closed Surfaces}

\begin{theorem}
    The closed connected surfaces are all homeomorphic to $S^2, T \# \cdots \# T$, $P^2 \# \cdots \# P^2$ 
\end{theorem}

\noindent
Need: Any closed surface can be triangulated. \\

\noindent
For any group $G$, and a map $\vp: G \to A$ with $A$ abelian, $\ker \vp$ will contain all commutators of the form $[a,b] = aba^{-1}b^{_1}$. Let $[G,G]$ be the subgroup generated by all commutators. This is a normal subgroup since $c[a,b]c^{-1} = caba^{-1}b^{-1}c^{-1} = [cac^{-1}, cbc^{-1}]$. Thus $G/[G,G]$ is commutative, all maps to abelian groups factor through it. If $\pi_1(X) \cong \pi_1(Y)$ , their abelianizations will be isomorphic. \\

\noindent
Note: $F/N \, /\, [F/N, F/N] \cong (F/[F,F])/$ image of $N$ \\

\noindent
$\pi_1(T \# \cdots \# T) = F_{2n}(a_1, b_1, \ldots, a_n, b_n)/N([a_1b_1] \cdots [a_nb_n])$. $F_{2n}/[F_{2n}, F_{2n}] \cong \bZ^{2n}$, we see the image of $N$ is 0. \\
Let $H_1(X) = \pi_1(X)/[\pi_1(X), \pi_1(X)]$, first homology group. We see $H_1(T \# \cdots \# T) = \bZ^{2n}$ \\
$\pi_1(P^2 \# \cdots \# P^2) = F_n(a_1, \ldots, a_n)/N(a_1^2\cdotsa_n^2)$. \\ 
$F_n/[F_n, F_n]= \bZ^n/$ image of $N$ so get $\bZ^n/Z(a_1 + \cdotss + a_n) \cong \bZ^{n-1} \times \bZ/2\bZ$.
