\subsection{Bases and Subbases}

Let $(X, \cT)$ be a topological space. 

\begin{definition}
    A subset $A$ of $X$ is said to be closed if $A'$ ($X-A$) is open. 
\end{definition}

\noindent
Let $\cC$ be the collection of closed subsets 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $X, \vn \in \cC$
    \item any (maybe infinite) intersection of closed sets is closed
    \item A finite union of closed sets is closed 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent 
Let $X$ be a set, any (maybe infinite) intersection of topologies on $X$ is a topology on $X$. \\
Thus, for any $\cS$, a subset of $X$, thete is a smallest topology that conatins $\cS$, namely the intersection of all topolgies that contain $\cS$. We sat that $\cS$ generates this topology. 

\begin{definition}
    If $\cS$ has the property that $\bigcup (U \in \cS) = X$, then $\cS$ is called a subbasis of the topology it generates. 
\end{definition}

\noindent
Let $\cI^{\cS}$ be the collection of all finite intersection of elements of $\cS$, then the intersection of a finite number of elements of $\cI^{\cS}$ is in $\cI^{\cS}$. 

\noindent
Let $\cI$ be a collection of subsets of $X$ (union of elements of $\cI$ is $X$) with the property that the intersection of a finite number of elements of $\cI$ is in $\cI$. Then the collection, $\cT$, of arbitrary unions of elements of $\cI$ is a topology (the smallest topology containing $\cI$) \\
Why is a finite intersection of elements of $\cT$ in $\cT$?  \\
Suppose $\cO_1 = \bigcup_{\alpha}U_{\alpha}^1$, $\cO_2 = \bigcup_{\beta} U_{\beta}^2$ with $U_{\alpha}^1 , U_{\beta}^2 \in \cI$, then $\cO_1 \cap \cO_2 = (\bigcup U_{\alpha}^1) \cap (\bigcup U_{\beta}^2) = \bigcup_{\alpha, \beta} (U_{\alpha}^1 \cap U_{\beta}^2).$

\begin{definition}
    Given a topological space $(X, \cT)$, a base for it is a set of subsets, $\cB$, of $\cT$ , with the property that every element of $\cT$ is a (maybe infinite) union of elements of $\cB$. 
\end{definition}

\noindent
If $\cS$ is a subbase for $\cT$, then $\cI^{\cS}$ is a base for $\cT$. \\
Note: definition does not require $\cB$ to be closed under finite intersection 

\noindent 
$(X,d)$ is a metric space, let $\cB$ be the set of open balls. Then $\cB$ is a base for the metric topology but usually the intersection of two open balls is not an open ball. \\
The intersection of finitely many elements of $\cB$ is the union of elements of $\cB$. \\

\noindent
Let $(X, \cT^X), (Y, \cT^Y)$ be topological spaces, and $\cS$ a subbase of $\cT^Y$. Let $f: X \to Y$, then $f$ is continuous if for every $U \in \cS$, $f^{-1}(U) \in \cT^X$. 

\begin{example}
    For $X = \bR$, $\cS = \{ (-\infty, a), (b, +\infty) \, : \, a, b\in \bQ\}$ generates the usual topology. 
\end{example}
