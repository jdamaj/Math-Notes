\subsection{Seifert- Van Kampen Theorem}

Let $G, H$ be groups and let $B$, be a group and suppose we have $\vp_G: B \to G$, injective, $\vp_H: H \to B$ injective. Form $G*H$, let $N$ = smallest normal subgroup containing the words $\vp_G(b)\vp_H(B^{-1})$, $G*H/N$ is denoted by $G*_BH$ and called the free product of $G$ and $G$ amalgamted over $B$. \\

\noindent
$X = U \cup V$, $U \cap V$ path connected. Consider the following diagram. \\

For $b \in \pi_1(U \cap V)$, $\vp_U(i_u(b)) = \vp_V(i_v(b))$ so $\psi(q_U(i_U(b)))q_V(i_V(b))=e$
