Let $X = U \cup V$ with $U, V$ open and $U \cap V$ path connected. Choose a basepoint $x_*$ in $U \cap V$. We have the following diagram: 
\[ \begin{tikzcd}
    & \pi_1(U) \arrow[rd] & \\ 
    \pi_1(U \cap V) \arrow[ru] \arrow[rd] & &  \pi_(X) \\ 
    & \pi_1(V) \arrow[ru] & 
\end{tikzcd}\]

\noindent
Given a group $G$ and elements $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, we say that $G$ is generated by $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ if $G$ is the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, ie. every element of $G$ can be written as a finite product of $x_j$'s and $x_j^{-1}$'s. 

\begin{theorem}
    $\pi_1(X)$ is generated by the images of $\pi_1(U)$ and $\pi_1(V)$ in $\pi_1(X)$ 
\end{theorem}

\begin{pf}
    Let $f$ be a loop in $X$ at $x_*$, $f: [0,1] \to X$. Want $0 =t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_n=1$ such that for each $j=1, \ldots, n$ $f([t_{j-1}, j])$ is either $ \subseteq U$ or $\subseteq V$ (or both). Let $J = \{t \, : \, [0,t]$ has the desired property$\}$. If $r \in J$ and $s < r$ then $s \in J$ ie, $J$ is an interval such that $J = [0, r_*]$ or $[0, r_*)$. Suppose $r_* < 1$, then WLOG $f(r_*) \in U$, then since $U$ is open and $f$ is continuous, there is $\ve > 0$ such that $f((r_* - \ve, r_* + \ve) \cap [0,1]) \subseteq U$, then since $r_* < 1$ we can find $s$, $r_* < s < r_* + \ve$ so from a subdivision of $[0, r_*]$ we get a subdivision of $[0,s]$ with the desired property, contradiction the fact that $r_*$ is the end of the interval so we must have $r_* = 1$. Since $f$ is continuous at 1, if $f(1) \in U$ there is $r<1$ with $f([r,1]) \subseteq U$ and have subdivision of $[0,r]$ so we have $1 \in J$. \\
    For each $t_j$ suppose that $f(t_j) \in U$ but $f(t_j) \not\in U \cap V$, then $f([t_{j-1}, t_j]) \subseteq U$ and $f([t_j, t_{j+1}]) \subseteq U$ so we can eliminate all $t_j$ for which $f(t_j) \not\in U \cap V$. Thus we can find $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_n=1$ such that $f(t_j) \in U \cap V$ for all $j$ and $f([t_{j-1}, t_j]) \subseteq U$ or $\subseteq V$. For each $j$ choose a path $g_j$ in $U \cap v$ from $x_*$ to $f(t_j)$, for $j=0,n$ choose the constant path. Let $f_j = f|_{[t_{j-1}, j]}$. Consider $(g_0 * f_1 * g_1^{-1}) * (g_1 * f_2 * g_2^{-1}) * \cdots * (g_{n-1} * f_n * g_n^{-1}) \sim f_1 * f_2 \cdots * f_n = f$. Each $(g_{j-1} * f_j * g_j^{-1})$ is a loop at $x_*$ in $U$ or $V$, so thm follows.
